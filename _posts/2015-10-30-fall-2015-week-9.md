In preparation for the Physics 107 midterms this Monday, I'll be holding a
problem session/study jam this **Sunday, Nov 1**, starting at **7:30pm** at
**Hashinger Science 131A**.  I have the room until 10:30pm, but I'll probably
be staying until 11pm, or whenever they kick us out; check this website for
updates.  Feel free to bring any friends or food :)

Because all of my students are in Prof. Dressler's class, I'll be prioritizing
questions about his exam in specific; but most questions/problems will
probably be applicable to both tests.

Remember to come with a sense of (physics) adventure, and problems/questions
that you would like to see/ask!

As always feel free to [send me an e-mail](mailto:jusle@chapman.edu) if you
have any questions or need any help.
