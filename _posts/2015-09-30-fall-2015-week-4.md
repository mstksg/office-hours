Special office hours session this week in preparation for the first exams (in
both Phys 101 and Phys 107) on Monday.

Will be at the **Leatherby Library 316** study rooms on Sunday **Oct. 4th**,
from **7:30p - 11:00p**.  The room is booked until midnight, so I'll probably
be there anyways...I'll post on this site when I'm leaving/if I'm still there
in case you still want to stop by.  You can also [e-mail
me](mailto:jusle@chapman.edu) too to ask!

I'm not allowed to tell you to bring food or anything :)

As usual I'll also be at Starbucks from **11:15p - 12:15p** on **Tuesday**
after the midterm this next week too.
